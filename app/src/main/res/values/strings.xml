    <string name="orang_utan_extinctionTitle">AMAZING WILDLIFE MOTHERS</string>
    <string name="orang_utan_awareness">
        The bond between an orangutan mother and her young is one of the strongest in nature.
        During the first two years of life,
        the young rely entirely on their mothers for both food and transportation.
        The moms stay with their young for six to seven years, teaching them where to find food,
        what and how to eat and the
        technique for building a sleeping nest. Female orangutans are known to “visit”
        their mothers until they reach the age of 15 or 16.

    <string name="orang_utan_threatTitle">IMPORTANCE AND THREATS</string>
    <string name="orang_utan_threatMsg">
        Sadly, orangutan numbers are declining due to:
        \n\n&#8226; Habitat degradation caused by unsustainable logging practices,
                    unsustainable land-use planning as well as forest
                    conversion for agriculture and infrastructure development.
        \n\n&#8226; Fragmented habitats resulting in isolated orangutan populations.
